description: 'This file contains information about truss which is an assemblage of
  long, slender structural elements that are connected at their ends. Trusses ?nd
  substantial use in modern construction, for instance as towers, bridges, sca?olding,
  etc. In addition to their practical importance as useful structures, truss elements

  have a dimensional simplicity that will help us extend further the concepts of mechanics
  introduced in the modules dealing with uniaxial response.'
